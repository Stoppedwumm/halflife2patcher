# Half Life 2 Patcher for ARM (Apple Silicon) Macs
This was written by me (because the manual process is sometimes complicated)

# How to use
Requirements: Git, Python

As no other modules are being used, you only need the `__main__.py` file

Run the file with python:
```bash
python __main__.py
# or
python3 __main__.py
```

Then, follow the instructions on the terminal.

The program will patch, after you gave it the Half Life 2 path, the game automatically.

You can then play Half Life 2 over steam now on your ARM Mac.
